            Born and raised in Southern California, I grew up in Manhattan Beach, before moving to San Diego for college.

            Living in these beautiful places has reinforced my loyalty to living in Southern California, but it hasn't quelled my desire to explore. 

            I've lived in Salt Lake City, Utah and Amsterdam. I'm also a dual citizen
            of both Switzerland and the United States.
